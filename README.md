# VirtualTourist
Built an app that allows users to tour the world without leaving the comforts of their couch. This app allows you to drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with that location. Locations and images are stored using Core Data.
## How to use
This app can be run on a device running iOS 10.0 or higher. Touch and hold on any location on the map. Tapping on the dropped pin displays Flickr photos found near the specified location, if any. Photos can be refreshed and deleted from the collection. Pin locations may also be deleted.
